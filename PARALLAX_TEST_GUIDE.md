## 🎬 Scroll Effect

When you **scroll through** the parallax section, you should see:

- Each layer **moves at a different speed** as you scroll
- Creates a **3D depth illusion**
- Layers in the back move slower
- Layers in the front move faster
- Text fades in and out smoothly
- Smooth, buttery smooth animations

## 🐛 If Something Looks Wrong

### **I see NO parallax section at all**
1. Scroll down to where you expect it (between Drawings & Contact)
2. Check if there's just white space
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for error messages in red

### **I see the section but NO images**
1. You should see colored backgrounds or your Gemini images
2. If blank, images might not be loading
3. Open browser console (F12) → Network tab
4. Look for "layer1.png", "layer2.png", etc.
5. Check if they show status 200 (loaded) or 404 (not found)

### **Images are there but NO scroll effect**
1. Try scrolling through the section
2. Layer backgrounds should move when scrolling
3. If not moving, the JavaScript might not be running
4. Check console (F12) for JavaScript errors

### **Text overlays not visible**
1. Should be white text on top of images
2. Should have readable shadow effect
3. If not visible, background image might be covering it
4. Try zooming in (Ctrl/Cmd + Plus)

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### **Fix 1: Hard Refresh Your Browser**
```
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```
This clears the cache and reloads everything fresh.

### **Fix 2: Check File Paths**
Open browser console (F12) and paste:
```javascript
const layers = document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-layer');
console.log('Found', layers.length, 'parallax layers');

document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-bg-img').forEach((img, i) => {
    console.log(`Layer ${i+1}:`, window.getComputedStyle(img).backgroundImage);
});
```

### **Fix 3: Check if Images Exist**
In terminal:
```bash
ls -lh assets/parallax/
```
Should show:
```
layer1.png  1.2M
layer2.png  939K
layer3.png  1.9M
layer4.png  1.4M
layer5.png  852K
```

### **Fix 4: Manually Load Images (Browser Console)**
```javascript
// Copy and paste this in browser console (F12)
const paths = ['assets/parallax/layer1.png', 'assets/parallax/layer2.png', 'assets/parallax/layer3.png', 'assets/parallax/layer4.png', 'assets/parallax/layer5.png'];
const imgs = document.querySelectorAll('.parallax-bg-img');

imgs.forEach((img, i) => {
    img.style.backgroundImage = `url('${paths[i]}')`;
    img.style.backgroundSize = 'cover';
    img.style.backgroundPosition = 'center';
    console.log(`Set layer ${i+1} image`);
});
```

## 📱 Mobile Testing

On mobile phones:
- Parallax might work differently (or be disabled)
- You should still see the images
- You should still see the text overlays
- Scroll behavior might be different but still visible

---

## 🎯 Expected File Sizes

Your images should be:
- layer1.png: ~1.2 MB
- layer2.png: ~939 KB  
- layer3.png: ~1.9 MB
- layer4.png: ~1.4 MB
- layer5.png: ~852 KB

**Total: ~6.2 MB**

If significantly different, images might not be copied correctly.

## 📊 Browser Developer Tools

To check the parallax section in detail:

1. **Open Developer Tools**: F12 or Right-click → Inspect
2. **Go to Elements tab**
3. **Find**: `<section id="parallax-showcase">`
4. **Check**:
   - Does it have a height/width?
   - Are the 5 layers visible?
   - Do they have background images?

## 🚀 Still Not Working?

1. **Save this guide** as a reference
2. **Take a screenshot** of what you see
3. **Open browser console** (F12) and run the diagnostic above
4. **Copy any error messages** from the console
5. **Check PARALLAX_DEBUG.md** for more detailed troubleshooting

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. ✅ Parallax section appears on the page
2. ✅ 5 distinct layers with images
3. ✅ Text overlays visible on each layer
4. ✅ Scrolling creates smooth parallax effect
