   - Smooth transition orchestration using GSAP

2. **Parallax Engine**
   - Multi-layer parallax controller using GSAP ScrollTrigger
   - Performance-optimized scroll handlers with requestAnimationFrame
   - Device-specific optimization system
   - Smooth interpolation for 60fps performance

3. **Animation Coordinator**
   - Centralized animation state management
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping animations
   - Performance monitoring and adaptive quality
   - Accessibility compliance with reduced motion support

4. **Performance Manager**
   - Device capability detection
   - Dynamic quality adjustment
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Frame rate monitoring

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Loading Screen

**Visual Elements:**
- **Morphing Logo**: SVG-based logo with animated path morphing using GSAP MorphSVG
- **Geometric Shapes**: CSS-animated floating shapes with blur effects and gradient backgrounds
- **Progress System**: Multi-stage progress with realistic loading simulation
- **Particle Field**: Three.js particle system with physics-based movement
- **Background Gradient**: Animated gradient with color transitions

**Loading Stages:**
1. Asset Preloading (0-20%): Load critical CSS, fonts, and images
2. Animation Setup (20-40%): Initialize GSAP, Three.js, and particle systems
3. Content Preparation (40-70%): Process portfolio items and setup scroll triggers
4. Final Optimization (70-90%): Complete initialization and performance checks
5. Ready State (90-100%): Final animations and transition preparation

### Parallax System Architecture

**Layer Structure:**
- **Background Layer**: Slowest movement (0.2x scroll speed)
- **Mid Layer**: Medium movement (0.5x scroll speed)  
- **Foreground Layer**: Normal movement (1x scroll speed)
- **UI Layer**: Fixed positioning with subtle float effects

**Scroll Zones:**
1. **Hero Parallax**: Background elements move at 0.3x speed, particles respond to scroll velocity
2. **Section Transitions**: Smooth parallax between content sections with fade effects
3. **Portfolio Parallax**: Cards have depth-based movement with 3D transforms
4. **Contact Parallax**: Background shapes move independently of content

### Animation Coordination System

**State Management:**
```javascript
AnimationState = {
  loading: boolean,
  scrolling: boolean,
  interacting: boolean,
  reducedMotion: boolean,
  performance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}
```

**Animation Queue:**
- Priority-based animation scheduling
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Performance-based animation culling
- Smooth transition between animation states

## Data Models

### Loading Progress Model
```javascript
LoadingProgress = {
  percentage: number (0-100),
  stage: string,
  stageIndex: number (0-5),
  assetsLoaded: number,
  totalAssets: number,
  startTime: timestamp,
  estimatedCompletion: timestamp
}
```

### Parallax Element Model
```javascript
ParallaxElement = {
  element: HTMLElement,
  speed: number (-1 to 1),
  direction: 'vertical' | 'horizontal' | 'both',
  bounds: { top, bottom, left, right },
  transform: { x, y, z, rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ },
  easing: string
}
```

### Performance Metrics Model
```javascript
PerformanceMetrics = {
  fps: number,
  memoryUsage: number,
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'tablet' | 'desktop',
  capabilities: {
    webgl: boolean,
    transforms3d: boolean,
    reducedMotion: boolean
  },
  qualityLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}
```

## Error Handling

### Loading Screen Fallbacks
- **WebGL Unavailable**: Fall back to CSS-only animations
- **Slow Network**: Implement timeout with simplified loading screen
- **JavaScript Disabled**: Show static loading message with CSS animation
- **Memory Constraints**: Reduce particle count and disable complex effects

### Parallax System Fallbacks
- **Performance Issues**: Automatically reduce parallax complexity
- **Mobile Devices**: Use transform3d with reduced effects
- **Reduced Motion**: Provide fade-in alternatives to parallax
- **Scroll Performance**: Throttle scroll events and reduce update frequency

### Animation Conflicts
- **Overlapping Animations**: Queue system with priority resolution
- **Memory Leaks**: Automatic cleanup of completed animations
- **Performance Degradation**: Dynamic quality adjustment
- **Browser Compatibility**: Feature detection with graceful degradation

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Continuous FPS tracking during animations
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in particle systems
- **Device Testing**: Test on various mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Network Conditions**: Test loading animations on slow connections

### Visual Testing
- **Cross-Browser**: Ensure consistent appearance across browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Verify animations work at all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and reduced motion preferences
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure loading screen meets accessibility standards

### User Experience Testing
- **Loading Time Perception**: Verify loading animations improve perceived performance
- **Scroll Smoothness**: Test parallax effects don't cause motion sickness
- **Interaction Responsiveness**: Ensure animations don't block user interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Verify site works without JavaScript
