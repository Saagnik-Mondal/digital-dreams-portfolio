# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing portfolio website with a more beautiful and sophisticated loading animation screen and implements comprehensive parallax scroll animations throughout the site. The enhancement will improve user engagement during the initial load time and create immersive scroll-based visual effects that respond to user interaction.

## Glossary

- **Loading_Screen**: The initial overlay interface displayed while website assets and animations are being prepared
- **Parallax_System**: A visual effect where background elements move at different speeds than foreground elements during scrolling
- **Animation_Engine**: The JavaScript system responsible for coordinating and managing all visual effects
- **Performance_Monitor**: System component that adjusts animation complexity based on device capabilities
- **Scroll_Controller**: Component that manages scroll-based animations and parallax effects

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see a visually stunning loading screen, so that I remain engaged while the site loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website begins loading, THE Loading_Screen SHALL display animated geometric shapes with smooth morphing transitions
2. WHILE the loading process is active, THE Loading_Screen SHALL show a progress indicator with realistic loading stages and percentage updates
3. THE Loading_Screen SHALL include particle effects that respond to simulated loading events
4. WHEN loading reaches 100%, THE Loading_Screen SHALL fade out with a smooth transition animation lasting no more than 1.5 seconds
5. THE Loading_Screen SHALL display branded visual elements that reinforce the creative portfolio theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want smooth parallax effects while scrolling, so that I experience an immersive and modern interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll through the hero section, THE Parallax_System SHALL move background elements at 0.5x scroll speed relative to foreground content
2. WHILE scrolling through portfolio sections, THE Parallax_System SHALL create depth effects by moving different layers at varying speeds
3. THE Parallax_System SHALL apply subtle parallax effects to section backgrounds without causing motion sickness
4. WHEN scrolling on mobile devices, THE Parallax_System SHALL provide reduced-motion alternatives to maintain performance
5. THE Parallax_System SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance during scroll interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want enhanced visual effects that respond to my interactions, so that the interface feels dynamic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I move my mouse over interactive elements, THE Animation_Engine SHALL create magnetic attraction effects with smooth easing
2. WHILE scrolling through content sections, THE Animation_Engine SHALL trigger reveal animations for text and images with staggered timing
3. THE Animation_Engine SHALL create floating particle effects in the background that respond to scroll position
4. WHEN portfolio cards come into view, THE Animation_Engine SHALL animate them with 3D transform effects and proper depth
5. THE Animation_Engine SHALL coordinate all animations to prevent conflicts and maintain visual harmony

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor using different devices, I want optimized animations that work well on my device, so that I have a smooth experience regardless of my hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site detects a mobile device, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL reduce animation complexity by 50%
2. WHILE running on low-performance devices, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL disable resource-intensive effects like particle systems
3. IF the user has enabled reduced motion preferences, THEN THE Performance_Monitor SHALL provide static alternatives to all animations
4. THE Performance_Monitor SHALL monitor frame rate and automatically adjust animation quality to maintain 60fps
5. WHERE touch interfaces are detected, THE Performance_Monitor SHALL optimize interactions for touch-based navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want scroll-based animations that enhance content presentation, so that information is revealed in an engaging and intuitive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content sections enter the viewport, THE Scroll_Controller SHALL trigger fade-in animations with appropriate timing
2. WHILE scrolling through the about section, THE Scroll_Controller SHALL animate skill items with staggered reveals
3. THE Scroll_Controller SHALL create smooth transitions between different content sections with parallax backgrounds
4. WHEN reaching the contact section, THE Scroll_Controller SHALL animate form elements and contact information with coordinated timing
5. THE Scroll_Controller SHALL provide scroll progress indicators that update smoothly during navigation
